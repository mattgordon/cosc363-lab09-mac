# Version of COSC363 OpenGL 4 Lab that builds on OS X

This assumes you are using the Homebrew package manager on OS X and that you have not changed its usual install directory of `/usr/local/`.

To build, the `glm` and `glew` packages must be installed via Homebrew, as well as Xcode. Then clone this repository and it `make && ./torusdraw` should work without any problems.
